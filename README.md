# LimeLight Gaming - Unofficial Launcher
###### Created By Hamza / Noot Noot / lots of other names


## What is this?
This program was coded using C# in Visual Studio 2015. It uses 2 Dlls, including MetroFramwork for the Metro styled theme, ~~and JSON.net for a later possible update to use the Limelight Gaming Update API to display some of the latest updates on the main tab of the program.~~

*Removed until it will be used*

## Overall Change Log

V1 - Initial Release

V1.1 - Complied into a single EXE using Illmerge (no longer needing the MetroFramework Dll with it)
