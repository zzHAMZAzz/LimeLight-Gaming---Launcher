# LimeLight Gaming - Unofficial Launcher
###### Created By Hamza / Noot Noot / lots of other names


## What is this?
This program was coded using C# in Visual Studio 2017. It uses 2 Dlls, including MetroFramwork for the Metro styled theme, ~~and JSON.net for a later possible update to use the Limelight Gaming Update API to display some of the latest updates on the main tab of the program.~~

*Removed until it will be used*

## If this is the source, where is the download?

Check the release tab on the GitHub repo

## Overall Change Log

V1 - Initial Release

V1.1 - Complied into a single EXE using Illmerge (no longer needing the MetroFramework Dll with it)

V1.2 - Version 1.2, brings in a scroll bar at the bottom for latest news and information regarding Limelight Gaming, this can be updated at anytime without requiring a program update. A updater is now in the program meaning whenever a newer version is available, the user will be notified at program launch. Finally all static images are stored locally, excpet server banners for obvious reasons

v2.0 - An updated refresh which updates the server IP addresses, map changes, and also updates the colour scheme to follow the forum
